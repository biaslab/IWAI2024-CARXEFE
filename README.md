## How do I run your experiments?

On OS X and Linux, run `./install.sh` to install packages, then run `./run-pluto.sh` which should open a tab in your browser.
On Windows, please run the commands listed in `install.sh` followed by the commands listed in `run-pluto.sh`.

In the new browser tab, open a Pluto notebook called `demo.jl` and select the `Run notebook code` tab on the upper right corner.

## How to I give feedback?

Please submit an issue.
